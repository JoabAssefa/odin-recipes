        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (16.3 ounce) can refrigerated biscuits</li>
                <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
                <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning</li>
                <li>¾ cup water</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, halved and sliced</li>
                <li>1 medium red bell pepper, halved and sliced (1 1/2 cups)</li>
                <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
                <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
                <li>8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
                <li>2 medium tomatoes, sliced</li>
                        
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
                <li>Place and press biscuit dough into the bottom of the baking pan and halfway up the sides.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Leave the oven on.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and cook ground beef until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Drain fat. Stir in taco seasoning and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Transfer cooked meat to a bowl and wipe out the skillet.</li>
                <li>Add onion and bell peppers to the same skillet and cook over medium heat until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine sour cream, mayonnaise, 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 of the onion-pepper mixture in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Layer browned meat, tomatoes, onion-pepper mixture, jalapeño peppers, and sour cream mixture on top of prebaked biscuit dough. Sprinkle with remaining Cheddar cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbly, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
               
            </ol>
